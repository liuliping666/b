We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the iterative reflection performance of LLMs. The empirical evidence suggests that the performances of these reflection methods are unsatisfactory, primarily due to the limitations of static iterative reflection, which leads to redundant, drift, and stubborn issues.

To mitigate this, we propose Instruct-of-Reflection (IoRT), a dynamic iterative reflection framework that integrates abstract reasoning into the reflection,  generating adaptive instruction to regulate the iterative reflection. 

## Setup

We recommend the use of conda environments:

```sh
conda create --name critic python=3.8
conda activate critic
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

We provide example bash scripts for each task as follows:



### Mathematical Reasoning

- Inference: `bash scripts/run_program_infer.sh`
- CRITIC: `bash scripts/run_program_critic.sh`
- Evaluation: `python -m src.program.evaluate`

### Commonsense Reasoning
