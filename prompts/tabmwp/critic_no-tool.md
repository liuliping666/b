Read the following table and then write Python code to answer a question:

llama | $2,860.00
macaw | $8,897.00
parrot | $1,586.00
boa constrictor | $1,382.00
kinkajou | $2,629.00

Question: How much money does Kendra need to buy a kinkajou and a parrot?
```python
kinkajou_price = 2629.00
parrot_price = 1586.00
total_money = kinkajou_price + parrot_price
```

What's the problem with the above code?

The problem with the above code is that it does not assign the result of the calculation to the variable answer. The code correctly calculates the total money Kendra needs to buy a kinkajou and a parrot, but it does not store the result in the answer variable.

Here's a better solution:
```python
kinkajou_price = 2629.00  
parrot_price = 1586.00  
total_money = kinkajou_price + parrot_price  
answer = total_money  
```

Read the following table regarding "Words per page" and then write Python code to answer a question:

Stem | Leaf 
3 | 3
4 | 1, 7, 8
5 | 2, 5, 6
6 | 0, 0, 1, 3, 4
7 | 2, 2, 4, 5, 8
8 | 0, 1, 4, 8
9 | 0

Question: Cameron counted the number of words per page in his new book. How many pages have at least 70 words but fewer than 90 words?
```python
pages_with_70_words = 0
pages_with_80_words = 0
pages_with_90_words = 0
for stem, leaf in zip(stem, leaf):
    if stem == 4 and leaf >= 7 and leaf <= 8:
        pages_with_70_words += 1
    elif stem == 5 and leaf >= 2 and leaf <= 6:
        pages_with_70_words += 1
    elif stem == 6 and leaf >= 0 and leaf <= 4:
        pages_with_70_words += 1
    elif stem == 7 and leaf >= 2 and leaf <= 8:
        pages_with_70_words += 1
    elif stem == 8 and leaf >= 0 and leaf <= 4:
        pages_with_70_words += 1
    elif stem == 9 and leaf == 0:
        pages_with_70_words += 1
```

What's the problem with the above code?

1. The above code causes a "NameError" because it uses the variables `stem` and `leaf` without defining them. Moreover, the code tries to iterate over `stem` and `leaf` using zip, which is not correct because the stem and leaf are actually part of a single data structure, not two separate lists.
2. The variable names in the code are a little bit confusing, and the logic for counting pages with at least 70 words but fewer than 90 words is not correct.

To solve the problem, we should first properly represent the stem and leaf data structure and then count the pages with at least 70 words but fewer than 90 words.

Here's a better solution:
```python
# Define stem and leaf data structure as a list of tuples  
stem_and_leaf = [(3, [3]), (4, [1, 7, 8]), (5, [2, 5, 6]), (6, [0, 0, 1, 3, 4]), (7, [2, 2, 4, 5, 8]), (8, [0, 1, 4, 8]), (9, [0])]  
  
# Initialize counter for pages with at least 70 words but fewer than 90 words  
pages_with_70_to_89_words = 0  
  
# Iterate through the stem and leaf data structure and count relevant pages  
for stem, leaf_list in stem_and_leaf:  
    for leaf in leaf_list:  
        words_per_page = stem * 10 + leaf  
        if 70 <= words_per_page < 90:  
            pages_with_70_to_89_words += 1  
  
answer = pages_with_70_to_89_words  
```

Read the following table and then write Python code to answer a question:

Number of cow pastures | Number of sprinklers
1 | 10
2 | 20
3 | 30
4 | 40
5 | 50
6 | ?

Question: Each cow pasture has 10 sprinklers. How many sprinklers are in 6 cow pastures?
```python
number_of_sprinklers_for_1_pasture = 10
number_of_sprinklers_for_2_pastures = 20
number_of_sprinklers_for_3_pastures = 30
number_of_sprinklers_for_4_pastures = 40
number_of_sprinklers_for_5_pastures = 50
number_of_sprinklers_for_6_pastures = number_of_sprinklers_for_5_pastures + number_of_sprinklers_for_1_pasture
answer = number_of_sprinklers_for_6_pastures
```

What's the problem with the above code?

There is no problem with the above code. It correctly answers the question and calculates the number of sprinklers in 6 cow pastures. However, the code can be simplified, as there's a clear pattern in the relationship between the number of cow pastures and the number of sprinklers.

Here's a better solution:
```python
number_of_pastures = 6  
sprinklers_per_pasture = 10  
total_sprinklers = number_of_pastures * sprinklers_per_pasture  
answer = total_sprinklers  
```

Read the following table regarding "Company sizes" and then write Python code to answer a question:

Company | Number of employees
Madison Corporation | 454
Downtown Publishing | 442
Thompson Corporation | 452
Bronson Attorneys | 428

Question: The board of commerce recorded how many employees work at each company. Which company has the fewest employees? Please select from the following options: ['Madison Corporation', 'Downtown Publishing', 'Thompson Corporation', 'Bronson Attorneys']
```python
company_sizes = [454, 442, 452, 428]
company_sizes = sorted(company_sizes)
answer = company_sizes[0]
```

What's the problem with the above code?

The problem with the above code is that it returns the number of employees of the company with the fewest employees but not the name of the company itself, which is what the question asks for.

To fix this issue, we should use a dictionary to store the company names and their corresponding number of employees. Then, we can find the company with the fewest employees by iterating through the dictionary and comparing the values.

Here's a better solution:
```python
# Store the company names and their corresponding number of employees in a dictionary  
companies = {'Madison Corporation': 454,  
             'Downtown Publishing': 442,  
             'Thompson Corporation': 452,  
             'Bronson Attorneys': 428}  
  
# Find the company with the fewest employees  
min_employees = float('inf')  
min_company = None  
  
for company, num_employees in companies.items():  
    if num_employees < min_employees:  
        min_employees = num_employees  
        min_company = company  
  
answer = min_company  
```
